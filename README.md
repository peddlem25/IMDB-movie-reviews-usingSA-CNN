Using IMDB public user-written reviews as an example and running it thought the spaCy v2.0 ML model, we can see what the users thought of a particular movie without the need for the rating star. Does this make review stars obsolete? or perhaps this is a great opportunity to explore using this ML model as "the-Rating-star".

Users would have to choose their words carefully when describing how they feel about a particular movie, restaurant and this added detailed information could help others looking for an option to make a more informed decision. 

Look out for a chatbot, widget soon.
